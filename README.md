## Notes

Everything I offer is self-coded with the best practices and latest standards. To ensure a smooth and scheduled development process, it is imperative to have a clear timeline and detailed plan of all the requirements you need before starting development.

Besides the development, every site needs configuration and setup that I take care of as well. This includes analytics, on-site SEO/accessibility, contact channels, notification settings, store policy templates as per Shopify's regulations, mobile/tablet/desktop/cross-browser final tweaks, and bug fixes. My pricing is all-inclusive of these features.

Components between Tiers are mutable, so feel free to mix/match to your needs for a custom quote.

> Post-development, I am available on demand hourly at $250/hourly via retainer.
