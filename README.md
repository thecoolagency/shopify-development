## Notes

I code everything myself, always using best practices and latest standards so it's good to have a clear plan of all the requirements and timeline needed before starting development, to make the development process smooth and on schedule.  
Besides the design/development, every site needs configuration and setup that I take care of: Analytics, On site SEO/Accessibility, contact channels and notification settings, store policies templates as per Shopify's regulations, mobile/tablet/desktop/cross-browser final tweaks and bug fixes. This is all included in pricing.  
The Tiers are not immutable, feel free to mix/match to your needs and I can provide a custom quote.

> Post development | I am available on demand via retainer.
