## Notes

I code everything myself, always using best practices and latest standards so it's good to have a clear plan of all the requirements and timeline needed before starting development, to make the development process smooth and on schedule.  
Besides the development, every site needs configuration and setup that I take care of: Analytics, On site SEO/Accessibility, contact channels and notification settings, store policies templates as per Shopify's regulations, mobile/tablet/desktop/cross-browser final tweaks and bug fixes. This is all included in pricing.  
The Tiers are not immutable, feel free to mix/match to your needs and I can provide a custom quote.

> Post development, I am available on demand via retainer.
